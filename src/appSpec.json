        "designSummary": "This brand design features a modern, minimalistic aesthetic with a strong emphasis on high contrast and vibrant accent colors. The primary background is a soft off-white, providing a neutral and clean canvas that enhances readability and visual comfort. The primary brand color is a vivid neon green, used boldly in large blocks, buttons, and accent elements to inject energy and a futuristic feel. Black is employed extensively for text and some background blocks, creating sharp contrast and clear visual hierarchy. Typography is clean, geometric sans-serif, with large, bold headings and smaller body text that maintains clarity and approachability. The layout is modular and asymmetrical yet balanced, with generous negative space and rounded corners on content blocks to soften the overall look. Simple geometric icons and repeated radial/starburst motifs in black and gray reinforce brand identity without clutter. Buttons are minimalistic, using neon green or black backgrounds with clear outlines and text. Overall, the design communicates a confident, innovative, and tech-savvy brand personality, suitable for professional services or consultancies focused on growth and modern solutions.",

When 'secondary' is used as a background, use 'secondaryForeground' for text to maintain legibility. The 'mediumGray' custom color is best suited for subtle UI elements like icons, borders, and secondary backgrounds to provide depth without overpowering the primary palette. Combining 'primary' and 'secondary' colors in adjacent blocks creates a dynamic visual rhythm, while ample negative space ensures the design remains uncluttered and accessible.",

      "paletteUsageGuide": "The primary color should be used for main call-to-action buttons, links, and interactive elements, with text or icons displayed in primaryForeground to ensure optimal legibility. The secondary color serves as a background for secondary or dark-themed sections, with secondaryForeground used for text and icons on these backgrounds. The background color provides a neutral and clean canvas for the overall layout. Custom colors such as iconPrimary, iconSecondaryLight, iconSecondaryMedium, and iconSecondaryDark are ideal for iconography and infographics, providing a harmonious range of greens and blues to support visual hierarchy and emphasis. Accent colors like iconAccentLight, iconAccentVeryLight, iconAccentLightest, and iconAccentWarm can be used sparingly to highlight special features, subtle borders, or decorative elements. The shapeStroke color is suitable for outlines and strokes around shapes and icons, maintaining consistency with the primary color. This palette supports a calming and accessible visual design, suitable for mobile-first and clean interfaces.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The combination of primary with primaryForeground ensures sufficient contrast for text and interactive elements, meeting WCAG AA standards. Secondary with secondaryForeground provides excellent contrast suitable for dark backgrounds, exceeding WCAG AAA standards. The background color paired with primary or secondary foreground colors supports high readability for body text and headings. Custom colors used for icons and accents should be tested for contrast when used with text or on backgrounds to maintain accessibility. Overall, this palette supports accessibility best practices across light and dark sections, ensuring legibility and user comfort."
